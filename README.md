# Tree-counting-using-CNN
Counting trees manually from satellite images above is a very tedious task. Fortunately, there are several techniques for automating tree counting. Morphological operations and classical segmentation algorithms like the watershed algorithm have been applied to tree counting with limited success so far. A unsupervised machine learning algorithm for calculating tree count and tracking trees in high resolution images. CNN convolutional neural network image classifier trained on a set of images for counting the number of trees from the images
